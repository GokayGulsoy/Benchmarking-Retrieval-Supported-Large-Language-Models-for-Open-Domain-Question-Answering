You should also test to make sure your water pressure regulator is doing its job and this is the exact procedure to do that. I hope this video helps.

Calculate how much more the position is worth to a well-qualified employee. Once you have your midpoint, you can add on to that amount to come up with the high end of the salary. One fair way is to establish an overall range, typically set at 40 percent. The midpoint represents center, so the high point would be an average of 17 percent more than the midpoint. This is called width of salary. Step 3. Establish the low point. Go back to your midpoint salary range and if you are still using the 40 percent width rule, deduct 17 percent from the midpoint.
